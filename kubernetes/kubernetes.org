* Kubenetes Basics
** Development and Deployment change in recent time 
From monolithic apps to microservices:

Fig 1. the horrible monolithic systems

There are too many interdependent parts in the monolithic system, so integration
and deployment were a nightmare. It forces to chopping them into individual 
"microservices", each of these "microservices" can now be debuged, updated, and
deployed individually without the whole project comming to a *standstill*.

The microservices have lots of pros, but as their number increasing, a problem 
is coming: How to manage this lots of microservices? how to provide a consistent
enviroment to all this applications?

** The gap between developers and oprationers

To reduce the number of problems that only show up in production, it would be
ideal if applications could run in the exact *same environment* during development
and in production so they have the exact same operating system, libraries, system con-
figuration, networking environment, and everything else.

Ideally, you want the developers to deploy applications themselves without know-
ing anything about the hardware infrastructure and without dealing with the ops
team. This is referred to as NoOps. Obviously, you still need someone to take care of
the hardware infrastructure, but ideally, without having to deal with peculiarities of
each application running on it.

Kubenetes is coming to rescure!!!
** Container technology
I don't want talk too much about container, you can go to Docker offical website to
find some amazing resouces and documents.

** The architecture of a Kubenetes cluster

So, the new sailer! Welcome to the ocean of Kubernetes! Fight the storms here, someday
later, you will become the best pilot in this ocean!!
