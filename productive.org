* fast directory change:
** when you working on a deep directory tree, use pushd,popd and dirs,
   for fast command line navagation:

   pushd /tmp/test1

   pushd /tmp/test8
   will push /tmp/test8 into the top of the stack and change cwd into /tmp/test8
   
   popd 
   will pop /tmp/test8 from the top of the stack and change back to /tmp/test1

   dird
   show current stack
** using "bd" utility
   pwd
   /tmp/dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4

   cd `bd dir2`
   will change to dir2 in this dir tree
* git clone a specific branch from repo:
  git clone --single-branch --branch <branchname> <remote-repo>
* branching in git:
  git do not store data as a series of changesets or differences, but instead of a series of *snapshots*;
  a nutshell about git branching:
  https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell
  
* block and unblock network traffic from a specific ip address:
  block:    sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 172.22.194.141 -j DROP
  unblock:  sudo iptables -D INPUT -s 172.22.194.141 -j DROP
