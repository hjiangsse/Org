* fast directory change:
** when you working on a deep directory tree, use pushd,popd and dirs,
   for fast command line navagation:

   pushd /tmp/test1

   pushd /tmp/test8
   will push /tmp/test8 into the top of the stack and change cwd into /tmp/test8
   
   popd 
   will pop /tmp/test8 from the top of the stack and change back to /tmp/test1

   dird
   show current stack
** using "bd" utility
   pwd
   /tmp/dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4

   cd `bd dir2`
   will change to dir2 in this dir tree
