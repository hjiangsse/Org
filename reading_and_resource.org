   But innovation or creativity is a strategic skill where every day you wake up 
   and it’s a totally unique context that no one’s ever been in, and you need to
    make good decisions in your completely unique environment. So as far as I can 
   tell, the only was we know way to teach strategic skills is by example, by seeing 
   tons of examples. The human brain, when you see enough examples, learns to internalize 
   those rules and guidelines for making good strategic decisions.
   
   But what is your best "flight simulator"? the answer is to embrace tons of examples!!!

   When I talk to researchers, when I talk to people wanting to engage in entrepreneurship, 
   I tell them that if you read research papers consistently, if you seriously study half a
    dozen papers a week and you do that for two years, after those two years you will have 
   learned a lot. This is a fantastic investment in your own long term development. 

   Chances are what you learned studying all Saturday won’t make you that much better at your 
   job the following Monday. There are very few, almost no short-term rewards for these things. 
   But it’s a fantastic long-term investment.

   The challenge that faces us is to find a way to scalably teach people to do non-routine non-repetitive work. 
   Our education system, historically, has not been good at doing that at scale. The top universities are good 
   at doing that for a relatively modest fraction of the population. But a lot of our population ends up doing 
   work that is important but also routine and repetitive. That’s a challenge that faces our educational system.

  线上性能问题的定位和优化是程序员进阶的必经之路

在做内存问题相关的 profiling 时：
  1. 若 gc 相关函数占用异常，可重点排查对象数量
  2. 解决速度问题（CPU占用）时，关注对象数量（ --inuse/alloc_objects ）指标
  3. 解决内存占用问题时，关注分配空间（ --inuse/alloc_space ）指标

  inuse 代表当前时刻的内存情况，alloc 代表从从程序启动到当前时刻累计的内存情况，一般情况下看 inuse 指标更重要一些，但某些时候两张图对比着看也能有些意外发现。
在日常 golang 编码时：
  1. 参数类型要检查，尤其是 sql 参数要检查（低级错误）
  2. 传递struct尽量使用指针，减少复制和内存占用消耗（尤其对于赋值给interface，会分配到堆上，额外增加gc消耗）
  3. 尽量不使用循环引用，除非逻辑真的需要
  4. 能在初始化中做的事就不要放到每次调用的时候做
